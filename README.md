## Introduction

Clean Architecture is a software design philosophy that separates the elements of a design into ringed layers. This repository implements the Clean Architecture principles using Python.

## Features

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clearly defined layers to ensure code is modular and easy to maintain.
- **Testability**: High test coverage with easy-to-write unit tests.
- **Scalability**: Designed to be scalable with minimal impact on existing code.
- **Flexibility**: Easy to replace parts of the codebase with minimal impact on other components.
